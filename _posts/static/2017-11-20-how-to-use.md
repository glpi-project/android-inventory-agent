The Android Inventory Agent features a complete inventory of your Android devices where both hardware and software information is collected.

Inventory Agent is running on Android 1.6 and higher.

After you [Install the app](http://flyve.org/android-inventory-agent/), you must define the server address and credentials where the inventory will be sent in the Global Settings section.

Also you will find the Privacy options, where you can decide what information will be sent between these two options Health Reports and Usage Data.
