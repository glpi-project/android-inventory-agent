# Flyve MDM Inventory Agent

The Android Inventory Agent features a complete inventory of your Android devices where both hardware and software information is collected.

## 1. Inventory sending

The Inventory is sent automatically to the server address with the credentials defined in the Global Sections through an HTTP Post Method.

The inventory can be send to:

* Inventory for GLPI 2.3.x and higher
* OCSInventory NG (ocsng) 1.3.x and 2.x
* Mandriva Pulse2

### 1.2. Automatize Inventory

An user can automatize both the inventory generation and sending, weekly, daily or monthly according to its own needs.

The Inventory Agent will restart its service to follow the new configuration.

## 2. Show and Share my inventory

Only when the Inventory is enabled, the user will be able to display the inventory of the device, and also have the option to share it in two formats JSON or XML by email, bluetooth, etc.

## 3. Privacy Options

Health report and Usage data will be sent if enabled.

The first is to send a Crash report using Bugsnag, in order to monitor any error that occurs in the application, and the second is for relevant and anonymous usage data.

## 4. Inventory disabled

If the Inventory is desactivated, automatically the options to run and automatize the inventory will be unavailable as the display of the same.

It will no longer send the inventory to the account defined.
